## Features

**_A note before you begin_**

The Bwaincell-pwa is a companion app to the Bwaincell Discord bot I built, I'll provide the link to it below. The bot and app were developed for personal use for me and my wife and my iteration of it won't be available to access publically, however, feel free to tinker and make it your own!

## Authentication

**Login Flow:**

1. Click "Sign in with Google"
2. Authenticate with Google account
3. Backend verifies Google ID token
4. Backend generates JWT access token
5. JWT stored in NextAuth session
6. Bearer token sent with every API request

**Security Features:**

- Google OAuth 2.0 authentication
- JWT bearer tokens for API requests
- Automatic token refresh
- Email whitelist on backend
- Session-based state management
- HTTPS enforced for production

**Supported Browsers:**

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Windows, macOS)
- ✅ Safari (macOS, iOS PWA)
- ✅ Firefox (Windows, macOS)

---

## Troubleshooting

### App won't install on iOS

- Ensure you're using Safari (not Chrome/Firefox)
- Check that the site is served over HTTPS
- Verify manifest.json is accessible
- Try clearing Safari cache

### OAuth authentication failing

- Verify Google OAuth credentials are correct
- Check that redirect URIs are configured in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your deployment URL
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### API requests failing

- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local`
- Verify backend is running at http://localhost:3000
- Check Network tab in DevTools for error details
- Ensure you're signed in with a whitelisted email

### Search not working in Notes

- Type your search query
- **Press Enter** to execute the search
- Backspace works normally, search resets when input is empty

### Database errors ("undefined user_id")

- Sign out and sign in again
- This typically happens after backend updates
- The OAuth flow will recreate your user record
